# Morphological Operations: Dilation

You are provided with the following image `B`:

```
0000000000
0111111100
0000111100
0000111100
0001111100
0000111100
0001100000
0000000000
0000000000
```

The structuring element `S` is given below, and its origin is the middle pixel.

```
111
111
111
```

After `B` is dilated with the structuring element `S`, what is the number of pixels marked `1` obtained in the image? Enter the appropriate integer in the text box below.

Alternatively, you may submit a program which computes and displays the required integer.
