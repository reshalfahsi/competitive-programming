# Morphological Operations: Dilation with an Irregular Structuring Element

You are provided the following image `B`

```
0000
0110
0000
```

The structuring element `S` is given below. The bottom left pixel is the origin of this structuring element.

```
10
11
```

What is the image obtained after `B` is dilated with the structuring element `S`? Enter the grid of 1s and 0s, or a program to compute it.

Your answer should look like:

```
1111
0000
1111
0000
```
