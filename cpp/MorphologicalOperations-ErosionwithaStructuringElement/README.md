# Morphological Operations: Erosion with a Structuring Element

You are provided the following image `B` 

```
00110
00110
00110
11111
```

The structuring element `S` is given below, and its' origin is the middle pixel.

```
1
1
1
```

What is the image obtained after `B` is eroded with the structuring element `S`? Enter the grid of 1s and 0s, or a program to compute it.

Your answer should look like:

```
11111
00001
11111
00001
```
