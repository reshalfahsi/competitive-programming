# Image Segmentation #2

Consider the following binary image where `0` is the background, and `1` represents a pixel on an object.

```
000110001010
111011110001
111010010010
100000000100 
```

If you segment this image using an algorithm based on simple **8 pixel connectivity**, how many 8-connected objects do you obtain? Enter the appropriate integer in the text box below.

Alternatively, you may submit a program which computes and displays the required integer.

## Hint

Use [Flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill)!
