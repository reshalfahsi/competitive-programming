# Mars Exploration

A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.

Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, `s`, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.


## Example

```python
s = 'SOSTOT'
```

The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.

## Function Description

Complete the marsExploration function in the editor below.

marsExploration has the following parameter(s):

- string s: the string as received on Earth

## Returns

- int: the number of letters changed during transmission

## Input Format

There is one line of input: a single string, `s`.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ length of s ≤ 99
- length of s modulo 3 = 0
- `s` will contain only uppercase English letters, ascii[A-Z].

## Sample Input 0

```
SOSSPSSQSSOR
```

## Sample Output 0

```
3
```

## Explanation 0

`s` = SOSSPSSQSSOR, and signal length `|s| = 12`. They sent `4` SOS messages (i.e.: `12/3 = 4`).

```
Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR
Difference:          X  X   X
```

## Sample Input 1

```
SOSSOT
```

## Sample Output 1

```
1
```

## Explanation 1

`s` = SOSSOT, and signal length `|s| = 6`. They sent `2` SOS messages (i.e.: `6/3 = 2`).

```
Expected Signal: SOSSOS
Received Signal: SOSSOT
Difference:           X
```

## Sample Input 2

```
SOSSOSSOS
```

## Sample Output 2

```
0
```

## Explanation 2

Since no character is altered, return 0.
